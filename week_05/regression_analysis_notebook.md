# Do a Longer Hike! 

One of the things to do for this week is watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN502AvbjT4) which will demonstrate how to do the next coding exercise. 

Head [here](http://datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https://github.com/UCB-MIDS/w241&branch=master&urlpath=rstudio) and navigate to `week_05>regression_analysis_notebook.Rmd` to work on an exercise.
